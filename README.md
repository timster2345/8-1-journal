Snhu Project 2
Timothy Milne


In this project, we were asked to make an application that shows the user to see how their investments would grow over time. I think the thing I did well in this project was punctuation. I believe that I had few errors including punctuation whether it be a missed semicolon or bracket. I cannot think of any ways to make improvements on the code as of right now, but I am sure that there are ways that it could be improved. The most challenging part of this code for me was the "setprecision". I do not know why, but this gave me tons of issues and I overcame this by taking a hefty break before coming back to it, and that seemed to give me the edge over this challenge. The skill that I took away from this project are creating a functioning chart that shows a desired output. I made this program maintainable by making sure that I did not overlap any code and ran the code multipule times to make sure there were no errors. I made this code readable by using whitespaces and extra lines so it wasn't all clustered up.
